We can create symlinks (symbolic links) in linux.

symlinks are shortcuts to files, binaries or directories.

Lets create a symlink from the poem you found a few dungeons back

to the current directory.

The spell for a symlink is:

< ln -s original_path destination_path > 

Remember that < .. > means behind and < . > means here.

Make a symlink with:

< ln -s ../../../peom . >

Then you can use 'cat' to read the poem right here,

eventhough its three directories behind.
