A shell function, stores a

series of commands for later execution.

When the name of a shell function is

used as a simple command name, 

the list of commands associated with that

function name is executed.

As an example, we can create a function that list

the directory contents right after we cd into it.

```
cs ()
{
    cd $* && ls
}
```
to type that in a single line:

cs(){ cd $* && ls }

type the above line into your terminal and use the cs 

command to cd into the chamber_of_loss directory
