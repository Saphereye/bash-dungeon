'rm' is the command we use to delete things in the shell.

'rm' is a very powerful command that can remove files and directories

Completely from your filesystem.

Meaning that they wont end up in a trash can! They will be gone!

FOREVER AND EVER!

To delete a directory with all of its contents, we can use:

«rm -rf dir »

The -f flag means that it will force remove everything and the -r 

stands for recursively removing everything.

We can make this dangerous command slightly safer by doing:

«rm -ri dir »

The -i flag makes the 'rm' command interactive.

It will ask you every time if it should remove something.

There is yet a safer way to remove things that allows us to

restore them if we make a mistake.

Install the following package from your distro's package manager.

'trash-cli' 

Next time you want to delete something, use:

«trash-put file or dir »

And if you want to restore it later, use:

«trash-restore »
