This chest is locked! 

The key to the chest, is the line count of the poem.

You need a spell for that! 

Look behind by using the « ls .. » spell 

Have you missed something?

« .. »always means one directory behind. 

Can you figure out how to use cat with « .. »

to read the spell you left behind?
